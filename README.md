pygame roguelike, just for fun

## Notes
This project uses art assets from [@calciumtrice](https://twitter.com/calciumtrice), because I have no artistic abilities.
All art credit is due to him.

This project requires a working pygame installation, and is built for Python 2.7.x, although I hope to bring it up to 3.4.x, once 3.4 is support by pygame.
